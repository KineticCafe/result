# Contributing

We value contributions to @kineticcafe/resultâ€”bug reports, feature
requests, and code contributions.

Before contributing patches, please read the [Licence.md](./Licence.md).

@kineticcafe/result is governed under the Kinetic Commerce Open Source [Code of
Conduct][].

## Code Guidelines

Our usual code contribution guidelines apply:

- Code changes _will not_ be accepted without tests. The test suite is written
  with [vitest][].
- Match our coding style. We use Biome to assist with this.
- Use a thoughtfully-named topic branch that contains your change. Rebase your
  commits into logical chunks as necessary.
- Use [quality commit messages][].
- The version number must not be changed except as part of the release process.
- Submit a pull request with your changes.
- New or changed behaviours require new or updated documentation.

A pull request will be accepted only if all code quality checks performed in
GitHub Actions pass.
